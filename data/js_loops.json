      "content": "A `for` loop in JavaScript is a control flow statement for executing code repeatedly. It's perfect for when you know in advance how many times you want a piece of code to run.<br/><br/>It has three parts: <br/>1. <strong>Initialization:</strong> `let i = 0` - Runs once before the loop starts. <br/>2. <strong>Condition:</strong> `i < 5` - Checked before each iteration. If it's `true`, the loop continues. <br/>3. <strong>Increment:</strong> `i++` - Runs after each iteration. <br/><br/>Here is the basic syntax: <br/>```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n  console.log('Current number is ' + i);\n}\n```"
