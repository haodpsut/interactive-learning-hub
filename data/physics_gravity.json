      "title": "What is Gravity?",
      "content": "Gravity is the force by which a planet or other body draws objects toward its center. The force of gravity keeps all of the planets in orbit around the sun.<br/><br/>On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity causes the ocean tides. The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of Earth is about <strong>9.8 m/s²</strong>. This means that, ignoring air resistance, the speed of an object falling freely will increase by about 9.8 meters per second every second."

      "question": "If you were on a planet with a gravity of 20 m/s², would you fall faster or slower than on Earth?",
      "choices": [
        { "text": "Faster", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "Slower", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "The same speed", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "A higher value for gravitational acceleration means the force pulling you down is stronger, so your speed would increase more rapidly, causing you to fall faster."
